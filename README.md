* Title: RNA-seq analysis of White and Asian women with breast cancer

* Author: Jieting Hu

# Overview of project:

* There are many people diagnosed with breast cancer. Some of them would have some genes with higher expression level than others. Indeed, both genetic and environmental factors would play a role in the development of this carcinoma. 

* In order to look further into the RNA gene expression difference of White and Asian women, especially the similarity and differences of the RNA gene expression, I decided to analyze the differential gene expression of The two groups. The purpose of this RNA-seq is to identify which genes have significant differences in expression between them TCGA website. The Vignette is from a paper: RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR.

# Milestone 1

* I should successfully select the correct dataset from the TCGA website, load them to R and so the data cleaning process to make it more accessible for limma package analysis. 

# Milestone 2

* I should follow the steps in Vignette and make sdjustment to get meaningful expression analysis.

# Deliverable

* R Markdown

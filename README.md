* Title: RNA-seq analysis of smoking and nonsmoking lung cancer patients 

* Author: Jieting Hu

# Overview of project:

* There are many people diagnosed with lung cancer. Some of them would smoke and some others would not. Indeed, both genetic and environmental factors would play a role in the development of this carcinoma. 

* In order to determine the effect of smoking on patients with lung cancer, especially the similarity and differences of the RNA gene expression, I decided to analyze the differential gene expression of people ever smoking and never smoking. The purpose of this RNA-seq is to identify which genes have significant differences in expression between the smoke and nonsmoke groups.The data is download from NCBI website. The Vignette is from a paper: RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR.
